## Introduction to Minimax Algorithm:

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making technique used in two-player turn-based games, such as chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe, etc. Its primary objective is to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. The algorithm evaluates possible moves by recursively exploring the game tree until a certain depth or terminal state is reached.

## How Minimax Works:

1. **Tree Representation**: The game state is represented as a tree, with each node representing a possible game state and edges representing possible moves.

2. **Evaluation Function**: At the terminal nodes (end of the game), the position is evaluated using a heuristic function to determine the score.

3. **Minimax Search**: Minimax proceeds recursively, starting from the current state of the game and alternating between two players: maximizing player (Max) and minimizing player (Min).

4. **Maximizing Player (Max)**: A player who tries to maximize their score. At each level of the tree, Max chooses the move that leads to the highest score.

5. **Minimizing Player (Min)**: A player who tries to minimize the score of the opponent. At each level, Min chooses the move that leads to the lowest score.

6. **Backtracking**: After reaching a terminal state or a specified depth, the algorithm backtracks, propagating the scores up the tree.

7. **Final Decision**: Once the search reaches the root node, the algorithm selects the move with the highest score for Max and the lowest score for Min.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning:

Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used to reduce the number of nodes explored by the Minimax algorithm. It eliminates branches that are guaranteed to be worse than previously examined branches, without affecting the final decision.

1. **Alpha and Beta Values**: 
   - Alpha represents the best score that the maximizing player (Max) has found so far.
   - Beta represents the best score that the minimizing player (Min) has found so far.

2. **Pruning Conditions**:
   - **Alpha Cutoff**: When the score found by Max along a path is greater than or equal to beta, Min will never choose this path. Thus, the search can be pruned, and further exploration is unnecessary.
   - **Beta Cutoff**: When the score found by Min along a path is less than or equal to alpha, Max will never choose this path. Hence, it can be pruned.

3. **Practical Implementation**:
   - During the Minimax search, whenever a node's score exceeds the bounds set by alpha and beta, the search in that direction is terminated.
   - This reduces the number of nodes explored significantly, especially in games with large branching factors.
